# Project Title

To build a machine learning model which predicts housing prices of any district and deploy it using Gradio framework as Housing app

# Project description

## What this Housing app does?

The task is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing prices, and so on for each block group in California. These block groups are referred to as a district.

The model learns from this data and be able to predict median housing prices of any district, given all other metrics.

## What additional python libraries are used?

1. numpy

2. pandas

3. scikit-learn

4. seaborn

5. matplotlib

6. python-dotenv

7. pymysql

8. catboost

9. xgboost

10. gradio

## What ML algorithms are used?

Following Machine learning regression algorithms are tested on the model and the best one is selected on the basis of best R2 score:

1. Random Forest

2. Decesion tree

3. Gradient boosting

4. Linear Regression

5. XGBregressor

6. CatBoosting regressor

7. Adaboost regressor

## Features of project

1. Modular programming approach

2. OOPS

3. Deployment as a web app using Gradio framework

4. Data read from SQL database

5. Custom Exception Handling

6. Logging


# Future scope of project

To deploy it on a cloud
